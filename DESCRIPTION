Description: Characterize daily stream discharge and water quality data
    and subsample water quality data. Provide dates, discharge, and water
    quality measurements and 'streamsampler' can find gaps, get summary
    statistics, and subsample according to common stream sampling protocols.
    Stream sampling protocols are described in Lee et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.08.059> 
    and Lee et al. (2019) <doi:10.3133/sir20195084>.
